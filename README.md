# Smart-Text-Classifier

## Introduction
**Smart Text Classifier** is a machine learning project focused on classifying SMS text messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). It leverages classical ML algorithms—**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**—to compare performance and identify the most effective method for spam detection. The project addresses challenges in automated text classification and showcases clear evaluation metrics for each model.

## Video Walkthrough of the project


## Video Walkthrough of the codebase


## Features
- Spam vs. ham classification using multiple ML models
- Data preprocessing, label encoding, and train-test splitting
- Performance visualization (precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)
- Results comparison across algorithms

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- Selected classical ML algorithms for interpretability and simplicity
- Used default hyperparameters for baseline model performance
- Applied standard text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Focused on model evaluation instead of app deployment
- Assumed labeled dataset with "spam" and "ham" categories

## Installation & Getting Started
Install dependencies and launch the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaileshahire06/Smart-Text-Classifier.git
cd smart-text-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
